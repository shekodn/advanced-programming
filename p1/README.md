# Research and code:
1. Differences on C ISOs (C11 and C99)
2.  A program that shows the Fibonacci sequence without using recursion. The user will let you know how many numbers he/she wants from it.
3. A program that let us know if a given number it prime

### Upload a word document with:
- Comparison on the ISOs (choose 5 to 7 important topics)
- Your code.
- Print screen with two use cases for each problem

### Tip:
- Use program parameters
- Research scanf() <- gets something from the console
- Research printf() <- prints something on the console
