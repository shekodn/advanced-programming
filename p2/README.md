# Code a program that will ask the user for:

- An integer
- A char
- A double

After you get the input, your program should show:

Your integer <<variable>> storage size is <<size>> bytes.

Your char <<variable>> storage size is <<size>> bytes. And I can read it as <<display it as character>> or as <<display it as integer>>.

Your double <<variable>> storage size is <<size>> bytes, I can read any number from <<Min positive value>> to <<Max positive value>> in this data type.

### Tips:

- Get to know the function sizeof()
- Look up the header file float.h, there might be some interesting macros inside it that could help you on printing the last line.
- If you still have not done it, go research functions printf() and the printing formats, and scanf(), remember that you need to pass the parameters in scanf() as reference;
- Remember to apply the coding standar, or you can loose up to 20% of your assignment

### Upload:
A word file with:
- Your code
- Two test cases, with print screens your .c file(s)
